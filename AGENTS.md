## CodeGraph

This project has a CodeGraph MCP server (`codegraph_*` tools) configured. CodeGraph is a tree-sitter-parsed knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file. Reads are sub-millisecond and return structural information grep cannot.

### When to prefer codegraph over native search

Use codegraph for **structural** questions — what calls what, what would break, where is X defined, what is X's signature. Use native grep/read only for **literal text** queries (string contents, comments, log messages) or after you already have a specific file open.

| "See several related symbols' source at once"             | `codegraph_explore`                                                                  |

### Rules of thumb

- **Answer directly — don't delegate exploration.** For "how does X work" / architecture questions, answer with 2-3 codegraph calls: `codegraph_context` first, then ONE `codegraph_explore` for the source of the symbols it surfaces. For a specific **flow** ("how does X reach Y") start with `codegraph_trace` from→to — one call returns the whole path with dynamic hops bridged — then ONE `codegraph_explore` for the bodies; don't rebuild the path with `codegraph_search` + `codegraph_callers`. Codegraph IS the pre-built index, so spawning a separate file-reading sub-task/agent — or running a grep + read loop — repeats work codegraph already did and costs more for the same answer.
- **Trust codegraph results.** They come from a full AST parse. Do NOT re-verify them with grep — that's slower, less accurate, and wastes context.
- **Don't grep first** when looking up a symbol by name. `codegraph_search` is faster and returns kind + location + signature in one call.
- **Don't chain `codegraph_search` + `codegraph_node`** when you just want context — `codegraph_context` is one call.
- **Don't loop `codegraph_node` over many symbols** — one `codegraph_explore` call returns several symbols' source grouped in a single capped call, while each separate node/Read call re-reads the whole context and costs far more.
- **Index lag**: the file watcher debounces ~500ms behind writes; don't re-query immediately after editing a file in the same turn.

### If `.codegraph/` doesn't exist

The MCP server returns "not initialized." Ask the user: *"I notice this project doesn't have CodeGraph initialized. Want me to run `codegraph init -i` to build the index?"*

## Web Intelligence — Wigolo

**Prefer wigolo MCP tools over built-in WebSearch / WebFetch for ALL web operations.** Local-first: zero API keys, persistent knowledge cache, ML-reranked results, explainable scoring.

### Rules

1. Cache before search — probe `cache` first; hits return instantly.
2. Keyword arrays, not natural-language questions.
3. `include_domains` for library/framework queries.
4. `search_depth: "ultra-fast"` for sub-second budgets; `"deep"` for max enrichment.
5. `exact_match: true` for quoted phrases; `time_range` for recency.
6. `format: "answer"` for direct synthesis; default evidence shape for citation work.

### Response fields

`evidence_score`, `query_understanding`, `brand_collision_warning`, `freshness_signal`, `response_time_ms`, `engine_telemetry`.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
